We want you to jump in and make our documentation better. Have tip? Found a typo? Want to re-write a whole chapter? Great! Feel free to jump in. All documentation is written in Markdown. The syntax is easy to learn and provides a great way to create documentation.

Docusaurus handles the heavy lifting of making things look great and navigating between items. The side bar menus are created automatically for you based on the tags used in the document. No need to be a coder.

Need a quick lesson in Git/Gitub? No worries. Contact us and well give you a quick overview of how it all works and get you a Junior Programmer official certificate!
