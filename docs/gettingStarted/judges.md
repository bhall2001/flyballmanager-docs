# Tournament judges

Even though this is only practice, we still need to make things semi-official. And to do that we need to have a judge. Adding a judge to our tournament is pretty easy.

Navigate to the Tournament Judges screen. All the NAFA judges can be found in the scrolling list on the left side of the screen. You can scroll through the list looking for the judge you need. But Flyball Manager makes it easy to add judges in.

In the search box you can type in the judges id (who knows that?) and any part or their first or last name. To find a judge you can type in any part of the judge's name. You need to be a little careful though. 

NAFA uses the legal names of folks. If Tom Lamont was judging your tournament and you type in "tom" into the search box, you'll notice Tom does not come up in the results. That's because as a NAFA judge Tom's first name is "Thomas". Our experience is you will have better hit results if you search on last name.

For our practice tournament enter "lam" to find Thomas Lamont as our head judge and click the right arrow to add him to the "Tournament" Judges list.

In a real tournament you will continue to add the judges in on this screen. Be sure the head judge is the first judge entered.

Now we need to create a Division for our practice tournament.
