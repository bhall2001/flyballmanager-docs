# Tournament Schedule

Our practice tournament is almost ready to go. We'll end this quick start guide by creating a schedule for our tournament.

## Generate Schedule

Click "Schedule" in the sidebar menu to navigate to the schedule screen. Our practice tournament is a pretty simple tournament to schedule since we only have 1 division. To generate the schedule click the "Generate Schedule" button.
