## How do I handle 2 single day tournaments?

Flyball Manager is designed to manage a single tournament. When hosting 2 single day tournaments on back to back days, each day is set up as a tournament independent of each other.

Entries for the tournaments can be imported from a .csv file. This assists with the initial setup of the tournaments. For information on this file please refer to the Tournament entries section of this documentation.

Lanes for the second tournament day can be reversed. This is detailed in the scheduling section of this documentation.
