# Placements

## Post tournament Placements

At the end of a tournament placements are easily generated on the Placements screen.

Steps needed to determine tournament placement:

1. navigate to the "Placements" screen
2. click the button `Calculate Placements`. This will determine the placements based on tournament points earned.

:::note
Teams who exceed maximum breakouts allowed receive no placement in the tournament. However, dogs are awarded points earned.

3. Handle ties. Ties are not automatically resolved. There are many ways to handle a tie. You will need to go through the ties based on your method to determine what the placements should be. To change the placement navigate to the Team screen and over-ride the placement assigned based on your calculations.

## Print Placements

The final placements can easily be printed out. We've even made the font super large and sorted the page from the lowest place to highest. This make reading the placements as easy as possible.

To print placements click the `Print Placements` button on the Placements screen.
