# Schedule

Flyball Manager generates tournament schedules using official NAFA racing schedules for round-robin tournaments. Our algorithms ensure teams are allotted the most distance between races. The schedule uses data entered from team entries and divisions to quickly generate the most efficient schedule for your tournament.

## Create

### Initial setup

Prior to creating a schedule, a tournament must be created with team entries and divisions. Please see the tournament section (coming soon) to learn how to get started with a tournament. Once teams and divisions are created, review the tournament Seed Chart to verify teams and divisions are set up as intended.

## Start order

The first step in generating a schedule is determining the start order for divisions. This is the order that the first race(s) for divisions will follow.

## Limitations

The scheduler supports round-robin tournaments only.

Importing a schedule is not allowed with Flyball Manager.
