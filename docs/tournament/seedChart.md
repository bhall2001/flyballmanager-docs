A critical document to any round-robin tournament is the seed chart. This document communicates the classifications, divisions and seeding order of teams entered in the tournament.

Flyball Manager generates the tournament seed chart from the entries and entered divisions for the tournament.

## Seed chart overview

The first line of each division provides summary information for the division. This information includes the division race format, breakout time, the total number of races for the division, total number of races for each team, the number of heats each team will run and the division spread. 

The spread is the difference in seed times from the highest seed to the lowest seed. The lower this number the more competitive the division should be.

## Export Seed chart

The seed chart created by Flyball Manager will need additional information before being published. The seed chart can be exported to a .csv file. This file can be imported into Google Docs, enhanced with additional information, and finally published to participants.

:::caution

Be sure not to modify any of the information generated by Flyball Manager. Parameters related to the tournament can not be modified outside of Flyball Manager. Doing so will result in inconsistency between the scoring app and publicly communicated information.
