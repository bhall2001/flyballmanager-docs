# Reports

## Overview

Reports allow for insight into details of the schedule. Reports are available by team, club or division. Each report shows the information needed for the tournament secretary, Regional Directors and participants. A blank line is placed in the report where the 2nd day of a multi-day tournament starts.

The data on the tournament screen is generated from the current tournament schedule. The reports can be used to find potential errors in the schedule. Once the schedule is finalized, the team and club reports can be exported. The exported files can easily be imported into Google Sheets for online access of the reports.
