## Result Labels

Race results are posted using labels. The labels communicate the result of each heat as well as the points earned by dogs and the team for the Tournament.

Labels are printed on 1"x4" standard labels. Each race results in 4 labels being printed, 2 each per team. Avery 8161 is a common label for ink jet printers.

**Single Race Label Example**

Sample labels for Race 1, teams BARK Off and Cruisin for a Brusin. 4 labels are printed for the single race.

### Reading labels

Each race a team will end up with 2 labels printed. The first label details the race results as recorded by the Scorer. The label details each heat including the heat number, dogs (by lineup number), the time, whether the heat was won, lost or tied, and the number of NAFA points awarded. The right side of the label details the points awarded for this race for dogs and the team.

The second label details the total number of points the team and dogs on the team have accumulated for the tournament. This label is a **running total** of all points awarded for the tournament.

### How to post labels

Labels are typically posted by division. A single poster board is created for each division. Turn the board to orient as landscape (horizontally long). Label the board at the top center with the division.

:::note
For larger sheets of poster board, it may be possible to fit multiple divisions on a single sheet.

Teams for the division are indicated in columns. Divide the board horizontal into equal parts based on how many teams are in the division. Write each team name in a row just below the division row creating a column for each team.

Labels for each team are placed in the column under the teams' name. Labels are intended to be placed on the boards in a specific order. Following the steps below reduces confusion about the information communicated by the labels.

The second label (total tournament points) should **ALWAYS** be the first label in the team's column. After each label is printed, the points are updated on this label. Place this label over-top of the prior points total label. 

There should always be only 1 race points total label visible and the label should always be the first label of the team's column.

The first label (race results) should be placed in the first empty space at the bottom of the column for the team. This way each individual race results can be viewed for the team.

Preferentially the labels will be placed on the board in the order of races. Be sure a team runs multiple times before labels are printed that the labels are posted by the race number in order.

## Fix scoring mistakes

Mistakes will happen and need correction. Not to worry. After race results are fixed on the scoring screen, new labels can be printed for the race. The label print dialog allows for printing of a single race if needed.

The new labels printed should be placed on top of the errant labels on the team's column. The first label will replace the posted results of the label with the mistake.

Point totals will be updated based on the correction made. The second label printed should be placed over the point total label at the top of the team column.

Posting labels takes a bit to get used to. The process may sound odd but when you get to the event you'll see this will all make sense.
